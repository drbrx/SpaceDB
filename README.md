After importing the required libraries as indicated in the requirements.txt file (pip install -r requirements.txt), the demo app can be run with the "python -m streamlit run main.py" command.

A config.json file is expected to be present in the same folder as the main.py file, in the following format:
{
    "host": "hostIpAddress/localhost",
    "port":0000,
    "user": "databaseUsername",
    "password": "databaseUserPassword"
}

The documentation for the project is included in the .pdf file and the whole databse, including some test records, can be regenerated by running the .sql export script.

MySQL was used in development, so while no particularly advanced features are ever used that would warrant incompatibility with other similar systems, MySQL is the recommended platfrom to run the project on.
